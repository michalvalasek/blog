    "comment": "How to integrate Rails & Phoenix - the author's team built the admin panel & jobs processing in Rails (fast to build, team more experienced), and the heavy-duty API in Phoenix (can easily handle the traffic & scale). They're enqueueing jobs from the Phoenix part while the Rails app is picking them up for processing. They're also forwarding the requests from Phoneix to Rails. Great approach if you need to gradually move part of your app (API?) to Phoenix."
