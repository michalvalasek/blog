### Games
- **1000 x RESIST** - my GOTY, beautiful storytelling, clever play with the medium
- **Felvidek** - really funny JRPG set in medieval Slovakia
- **Helldivers 2** - dumb fun with friends, beautiful environments
- **Persona 5** & **Metaphor Re:Phantasio** - I finally tried this style of JRPG and i quite liked it
- **Path of Exile 2** - I had an absolute blast with this one... until i've hit a wall with one boss halfway through the campaign :(
- **Guardians of the Galaxy**

### Movies and Shows
- **Tatami**
- **The Old Oak**
- **Civil War**
- **The Legend of Vox Machina**
- **Arcane** - although not as breathtaking as the first one, the second season was still very enjoyable

Lots of great boos this year, kinda hard to pick:
- Y. Varoufakis: **Technofeudalism**
- J. Hickel: **Less Is More**
- N. Stephenson: **Anathem**
- T. Chieng: **Stories of Your Life**
- J. Zohar: **Code is for Humans**
- K. Beck: **Tidy First?**

### Podcasts
- **Revolutions** - out of blue Mike dropped a new (11th) season about Martian Revolution. Plus, he annonced that it won't be the last and he'll be doing more seasons about revolutions in 20th century. Yay!
- **People's History of Ideas** - very detailed history of the Chinese Revolution.
- **Mindscape** - interviews with scientists from various fields
- **Tech Won't Save Us** - tech critical interviews
- **Blowback** (4th season) - very interesting history of the war in Cambodia

### Other
- **Bicycle** - after i injured my knee on the spring ultramarathon, i bought a gravel bike as an attempt to give the knee some rest but stay in shape at the same time. I completely fell for it, even joined a local biking club and bought a road bike. I've become a living stereotype (MAMIL), but love it nevertheless :D
- **Tiger and Dragon** - a board game that we played the most with kids this year
- **Critical** - "proto" tabletop RPG that we also played with kids a lot. I'd say it's a bit too simplified, but it's zero prep and still quite enjoyable, the kids liked it.
